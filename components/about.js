								The TruContact CSR Nigeria seed was sown long before the
								founder;{" "}
								<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Kenneth Egbas</span> would
								even conceive the dream of starting a company. Life didnâ€™t
								always hand him a fair deal. From his early days and upon
								graduation from university he always dreamed of running a
								business based on the idea that outcomes from his business
								activities would promote innovation, equitable distribution of
								resources, justice, reduce wastage and help eradicate poverty in
								Africa. This gave wings to the dream that became TruContact CSR
								Nigeria.

								TCSRN was founded in 2006, and carried out what many have come
								to acknowledge as trail blazing spadework that led to a rapid
								growth of what has become a vibrant and viable corporate social
								responsibility and sustainability industry in Nigeria, and
								Africa.
